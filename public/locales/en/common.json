          "whatIsClosing": {
            "question": "What is a real estate closing?",
            "answer": "A real estate closing is the final step in a property transaction where ownership officially transfers from seller to buyer. As your title agent, we coordinate all parties, ensure documents are properly executed, funds are distributed, and the title is recorded."

          "howLong": {
            "question": "How long does a typical closing take?",
            "answer": "Most residential closings take 30-45 days from contract to close. However, cash transactions can close much faster. We work efficiently to meet your timeline while ensuring all details are handled properly."
          },
          "whatToBring": {
            "question": "What do I need to bring to closing?",
            "answer": "Bring a valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license or passport). If you're the buyer, you'll also need a cashier's check or wire transfer for closing costs. We'll provide a detailed closing disclosure beforehand so you know the exact amount."
          },
          "mobileClosings": {
            "question": "Do you offer mobile closings?",

            "answer": "A will ensures your assets are distributed according to your wishes and can name guardians for minor children. Without a will, state law determines how your property is divided, which may not align with your preferences."
          },
          "willVsTrust": {
            "question": "What's the difference between a will and a trust?",
            "answer": "A will goes through probate court after death, while a trust can transfer assets immediately without court involvement. Trusts offer more privacy and can be useful for complex estates. We can help determine which is right for your situation."

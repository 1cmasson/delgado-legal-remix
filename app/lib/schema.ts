  {
    question: "What is a real estate closing?",
    answer: "A real estate closing is the final step in a property transaction where ownership is legally transferred from the seller to the buyer. It involves signing documents, transferring funds, and recording the deed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical closing take?",
    answer: "A typical real estate closing takes 30-45 days from contract to close, though this can vary based on financing, inspections, and other factors.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents should I bring to closing?",
    answer: "You should bring a valid government-issued photo ID, proof of homeowner's insurance, certified funds or wire transfer confirmation, and any documents your attorney or lender has requested.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer mobile closings?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer mobile closings throughout South Florida for your convenience. We can meet at your home, office, or another convenient location.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you work with real estate agents?",
    answer: "We work closely with real estate agents throughout the transaction, providing timely communication, coordinating schedules, and ensuring a smooth closing process for their clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle complex transactions?",
    answer: "Yes, we handle complex transactions including commercial properties, multi-unit properties, short sales, and transactions involving trusts or estates.",
  },
  {
